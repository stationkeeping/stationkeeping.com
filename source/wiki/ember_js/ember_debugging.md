Very nice video [here](https://vimeo.com/37539737).

#### General

Log routing:

```
App = Ember.Application.create({
  LOG_TRANSITIONS: true
});
```

Log Binding:

```
Ember.LOG_BINDINGS = true;
```

Ember adds the ability to use `toString()`

```
SomeClass.toString();
someObject.toString()
```

Get a reference to a view:

Look at the id of the view (a uid generated by Ember) e.g. `ember1546` then use the view hash:

```
Ember.View.views['ember1546'].get['element'];
```

#### Handlebars / Templates

Print a property to the console:

```
{{log something}}
```

Trigger the debugger:

```
{{debugger}}
```

See Routes (via a hash):

```
App.Router.router.recognizer.names
```
