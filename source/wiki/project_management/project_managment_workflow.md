## Use [Trello](https://trello.com/) & [Github](https://github.com)

Setup the following lists:

1. Todo
2. Doing
3. Done
4. Q&A
5. Verified

### Workflow

1. Create cards in the _todo_ list specific to project tasks and assign to a user. 
2. When a user begins the task they drag it into _doing_.
3. Create a new git branch (off master) using the card name for the branch name.
4. On completion of the task, drag the card into the _done_ list (trello) and send a _pull request_ (git).
5. Another user then verifies the pull request, merges the branch into master (git) and then drags the card into the _verified_ list (trello).

### Tips

Setup [@trello](https://twitter.com/trello) as an OS X app using [Mac Chrome application shortcut generator](http://www.lessannoyingcrm.com/articles/240/Updates_to_Mac_Chrome_application_shortcuts_and_the_iOS_fullscreen_webapp_generator), plus a tasty [icon](http://cl.ly/GZcm).
